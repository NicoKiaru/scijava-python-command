# scijava-python-command

A repository that facilitates the creation and use of Scijava commands from Python.

This repository is experimental. It provides:

* a way to define a Scijava command in Python, that would be accessible from ImageJ through PyImageJ / JPype.
* a jupyter UI for Scijava command that uses IPyWidget.

On the Java side, this repo depends on `ch.epfl.biop:pyimagej-scijava-command`

This repo needs pyimagej, ipywidgets, ipyfilechooser, openjdk=8
